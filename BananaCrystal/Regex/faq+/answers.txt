The strength of characters in One Piece is subjective, but some of the most powerful characters include the Yonko (Four Emperors) and the Admirals of the Marines.

Devil Fruits are mysterious, distinctive fruits scattered throughout the world, known for permanently granting their eaters superhuman powers and an equally permanent inability to swim. With only one notable exception, an individual can only acquire the powers of a single Devil Fruit and survive.

Haki is a mysterious power that allows the user to utilize their own spiritual energy for various purposes. All living creatures in the world are capable of learning Haki; however, most people do not notice it or fail to awaken it. Haki users are common in the New World, rare in Paradise, and basically non-existent in the Four Blues.
Yes, there are three different types of Haki system in One Piece. 1. Kenbunshoku Haki Observation Haki, which gives the user a sixth sense of the world around them, allowing them to sense the presence, strength, and emotions of other people, even if they are out of sight or far away. 2. Busoshoku Haki  Armament Haki, which allows the user to use their own aura as armor to defend against attacks, as well as make their own attacks more potent. It can also be used to bypass Devil Fruit defenses, such as the intangibility of a Logia. 3. Haoshoku Haki Conqueror's Haki, which grants the user the ability to unleash their own willpower in order to overpower the will of others. This results in victims being mentally overwhelmed by the user, with particularly weak-willed foes instantly losing consciousness.
